# challenge-1 (Horieson Marketing)

## Description
The first odd numbered week challenge I was given a task to reprogram and properly label semantic HTMl tags for the Horieson Marketing website,so that it would be more accessible to the browser. By doing so I replaced several <div> and <span> elements within the HTMl file by and added the correct class/id attributes to each one.
